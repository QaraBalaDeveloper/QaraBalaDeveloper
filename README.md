# Hello, I'm QaraBala ðŸ‘‹

I am a beginner PHP developer with 6-7 months of experience and basic knowledge of Laravel. I specialize in building simple web applications, working with databases, and creating REST APIs. I'm eager to take on small projects to improve my skills, help clients bring their ideas to life, and build my portfolio.

## What I Can Do
- Develop web applications using PHP and Laravel.  
- Create and integrate REST APIs.  
- Work with MySQL databases (migrations, queries, optimization).  
- Basic frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap).
